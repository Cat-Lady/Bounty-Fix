# Bounty-Fix
This ES plugin makes Pirates/Marauders that are subject of Bounty Hunting missions be properly seen as enemies by Militia/Navy/Deep Security/Merchants and other forces that should dislike Marauders/Pirates.

In other words, militia will no longer "pick their noses" watching as pirates plunder your merchant fleet in their system, just because said pirates have a bounty on their head that you want to collect. Bounty hunter/bounty "prizes" wills till focus on player and player's ships whenever possible, but they will now actually defend themselves from other attackers, too.

Also, bounty hunters paid by government to hunt pirate player and bounty hunters paid by pirates to hunt law-abiding player were split into separate "factions", with separate likes/disliked - unlike vanilla, where they are same "group"...
