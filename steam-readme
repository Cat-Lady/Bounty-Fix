[h1]This plugin is a part of upcoming "Endless Sky: Captain's Edition" reboot of the base game. Stay tuned - meanwhile, installing the plugins can help to preview the experience, together or in parts.[/h1]

This plugin makes Pirates/Marauders that are subject of Bounty Hunting missions be properly seen as enemies by Militia/Navy/Deep Security/Merchants and other forces that should dislike Marauders/Pirates.


[h1]Features[/h1]

[list][*]Militia/Navy/other law enforcement will no longer "pick their noses" watching as pirates plunder your merchant fleet in their system, just because said pirates have a bounty on their head that you want to collect.

[*]Bounty hunter/bounty "prizes" wills till focus on player and player's ships whenever possible, but they will now actually defend themselves from other attackers, too.

[*]Bounty hunters paid by government to hunt pirate player and bounty hunters paid by pirates to hunt law-abiding player were split into separate "factions", with separate likes/disliked - unlike vanilla implementation, where they are same "group"...


[h1]Installing[/h1]

...for latest, pre-packaged version.


[b]1.[/b] Use files from [i]vanilla-files-replace[/i] directory to replace files in your ES installation's [i]/data/[/i] directory. Overwrite files when prompted.

Do [b]not[/b] put [i]vanilla-files-replace[/i] inside your [i]/data/[/i] directory - it won't work like that. You need to directly replace appropriate files with plugin's ones.

This step of replacing vanilla files is result of ES incomplete ability to handle plugin's data (not replacing vanilla ship variants), and without the project issuing a fix, nothing can be done to remedy the necessity.
